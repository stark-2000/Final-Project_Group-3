# Acme's Autonomous Robot

## Project Overview and Description:
 - For the final project, me and my teammate have decided to choose multi-robot/swarm action category for Acmeâ€™s new line up of autonomous robots. These are developed as part of a 5 year product road map for ACME in developing their fleet of autonomous. We will work on the deliverables and provide a high-quality solution following the essential software engineering practices which they can directly integrate into their product.
 - We will deploy a swarm of 20 turtlebots, which will collectively perform a task of crossing a narrow passage. Their default pattern will be a square or rectangle. 
 - swarm_robot_ros_sim contains packages each of which features a set of functionalities for this simulation platform:

-  swarm_robot_description package describes the robot models and simulation environment initialization files.

-  swarm_robot_msgs folder contains packages for customized messages, services and actions that will be used in other packages.

-  swarm_robot_controller package contains the low level controllers for the swarm robots.

-  swarm_robot_simulation package contains the swarm algorithms.

## Purpose of the Project
 - The purpose this project is to deploy simple swarm algorithm on 21 bots to form and deform a pattern in order to navigate a narrow passage. linear curve fitting algorithm be  used to realize the line formation and simulate the project in Gazebo.
